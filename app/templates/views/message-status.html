  <h1 class="heading-large">Message status</h1>

  <p>When you send a message using Notification, it moves through different states.</p>
  <p>Notification’s real-time dashboard lets you check the status of any message, to see when it was delivered. You can also use our API to check the status of your messages.</p>
  <p>For <a href="{{ url_for("main.security") }}">security</a>, this information is only available for 7 days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.</p>

           steps when messages fail, deleting data and trying a new channel for permanent failures, and trying again or trying a new channel for
           temporary failures"

  <h2 id="messagestatus" class="heading-medium">Types of message status</h2>
  <p>These are the types of message status you’ll see when you’re signed in to Notification.</p>
  <p>If you’re using our API, some of the statuses you’ll see will be different. Read our <a href="{{ url_for('.documentation') }}">documentation</a> for a detailed list of API message statuses.</p>
