    <li>protect user data</li>

  <p>On Notify, data is encrypted:</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>when it passes through the service</li>

  <p>Some messages include sensitive information like security codes or password reset links.</p>
  <p>If you’re sending a message with sensitive information, you can choose to hide those details on the Notify dashboard once the message has been sent. This means that only the message recipient will be able to see that information.</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>your email address and password</li>
    <li>a text message code that Notify sends to your phone</li>
