<p>
  When you send a message it moves through different states in GC Notify.
</p>
<p>
  You can check the outcome to see whether the message was successfully delivered or failed and track the number of messages sent and their status after sending in the real-time dashboard.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<img
    alt="An example of how the message delivery status displays in the application after sending 8 messages total. A dashboard shows 2 are sending, 5 were delivered and 1 failed. This data is available for 7 days and is downloadable in a report."
    loading="lazy"
    src="{{ asset_s3_url('message-status-image-en.svg') }}"
  />
<br />

<p>
  For security reasons, this information is only available for 7 days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Types of message status</h2>
<p>
  GC Notify has the following types of message delivery status:
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Sending</h3>
<p>
  This means that GC Notify has sent the message to the email or cellular provider. If a text message was sent internationally, some countries do not provide any additional delivery information.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Delivered</h3>
<p>
  This means the message was successfully delivered to a userâ€™s inbox or phone. GC Notify will not tell you if a user has opened or read a message.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Failed</h3>
<p>
  If a message fails to be delivered, you can retry after 72 hours or try a different channel. If a message fails consistently you should remove these contacts from your database.
</p>
<p>
  A message may fail to be delivered for several reasons:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
  <li>
    The email address or phone number does not exist.
  </li>
  <li class="pt-4">
    The recipient is not accepting messages right now.
  </li>
  <li class="pt-4">
    The message is being blocked by the email or phone carrier.
  </li>
  <li class="pt-4">
    The message content is invalid or is being blocked as spam.
  </li>
  <li class="pt-4">
    The destination is on a blocked list.
  </li>
  <li class="pt-4">
    The recipient has opted out of messages.
  </li>
</ul>
